## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   An active Firebase project
*   A Google AI (Gemini) API Key (which you will provide in the app)

### 1. Configuration

First, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Firebase credentials.

```env
# Firebase Client-Side Keys (for authentication)
# These are safe to be exposed on the client.
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID"
```

**Note:** You no longer need to add a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to this file. The application will prompt you to enter your Gemini API key after you log in.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts & Features

### Authentication & API Key Management

*   **Firebase Authentication**: The app supports email/password and Google Sign-In.
*   **User-Provided API Key**: After logging in for the first time, users are prompted to enter their Google Gemini API key.
*   **Secure Local Storage**: The API key is stored securely in the browser's `localStorage`, scoped to the logged-in user. It is never exposed in the source code or sent to any server other than Google's AI services.

### The Kanban Board (`/board`)

This is the central hub of the application.
*   **Columns**: Tasks are organized into three status columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
*   **Drag & Drop**: Users can move tasks between columns by dragging them.
*   **Filtering & Searching**: A powerful set of filters allows users to find tasks by keyword, priority, or due date.
*   **Compact View**: A toggle to reduce the size of task cards for a more condensed overview.

### AI-Powered Productivity

Genkit is used to integrate Google's Gemini models, providing a suite of AI features:

| Feature           | Description                                                                                             | Triggered By                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Smart Sort**    | Analyzes all non-completed tasks and re-assigns their priority based on urgency and importance.           | "Smart Sort" button on the Board page.           |
| **Smart Create**  | Takes a simple title and generates a full description, priority, subtasks, and a relevant cover image.    | "AI Smart Create" button in the New Task dialog. |
| **Quick Add**     | Parses a natural language string (e.g., "Deploy app next Friday high priority") into a structured task. | Quick Add (`Sparkles` icon) popover in the nav.  |
| **Generate Image**| Creates a unique, professional cover image for a task based on its title.                                 | "Generate with AI" button in the task dialogs.   |
| **Generate Subs.**| Suggests a list of actionable subtasks based on the task's title and description.                       | "Suggest with AI" button in the task dialogs.    |
| **AI Insights**   | Provides a short, motivational summary of the user's current task statistics.                           | AI-Powered Insights card on the Dashboard.       |
| **Audio Summary** | Converts the AI-generated dashboard summary into speech.                                                  | `Volume2` icon on the AI Insights card.          |


### Application Views

Beyond the board, TaskFlow offers several other pages to help users stay organized:

*   **/dashboard**: A high-level overview of productivity. It features:
    *   Statistic cards for total tasks, completion rate, overdue tasks, etc.
    *   Bar and Pie charts visualizing tasks by status and priority.
    *   Lists of upcoming and overdue tasks.
    *   The AI-powered insights summary.

*   **/calendar**: A full-page calendar that displays tasks based on their due dates. Clicking a day shows all tasks due on that date.

*   **/notifications**: An activity feed that shows a chronological history of all actions, such as creating, updating, or completing tasks.

### User Experience Enhancements

*   **Command Palette**: Accessible via `âŒ˜K` or `Ctrl+K`, it allows for quick searching and navigation to any task.
*   **Toasts & Notifications**: Provides instant feedback for actions like creating or deleting tasks.
*   **User-Scoped Data**: All task and notification data is saved in `localStorage` tied to the current user's UID, ensuring data privacy and separation.
